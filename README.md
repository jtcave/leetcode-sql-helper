# leetcode-sql-helper

This is a little script I made to make the SQL problems at [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) easier to iterate on.

It imports the JSON test case format into a SQLite database, then opens the `sqlite3` program to manipulate the database.

This depends on:

* Python 3 (tested on 3.9+)
    * needs the sqlite3 module
* The `sqlite3` program
